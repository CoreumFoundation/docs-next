# Coreum Fungible Token

This document specifies `assetft` module, which allows public users of the blockchain to create
fungible tokens on Coreum blockchain.

# Concepts

In this section we will provide the detailed behavior of fungible token creation and management.

Here is the list of functionalities provided by this module, we will examine each of them
separately.

-   Mint
-   Burn
-   Freeze
-   Global Freeze
-   Whitelist
-   IBC transfers
-   Block smart contracts
-   Clawback

## Interaction with bank module, introducing wbank module

Coreum uses native Cosmos SDK bank module which is responsible for tracking fungible token creation
and balances of each account. But this module does not allow any public to create a fungible token,
mint/burn it, and also does not allow for other features such as freezing and whitelisting. To work
around this issue we have wrapped the `bank` module into the `wbank` module.

In `wbank` module we wrap all the send related methods of the `bank` module and intercept them with
`BeforeSend` and `BeforeInputOutput` functions provided by `assetft` module. This allows `assetft`
module to inject custom logic into interceptor functions and reject some transaction if whitelisting
or freezing criteria are not met, or apply other features such as BurnRate.

This structure allows to reuse the code provided by Cosmos SDK, and also reuse the infrastructure
that the community provides (e.g. explorers and wallets). But it also leads to the fact that some of
the information regarding fungible tokens will exist in the `assetft` module and some in the `bank`
module. For example, if you want to query for frozen balances of a fungible token, you need to query
the `assetft` module but if you want to get the total supply, you must query the bank module.

In a nutshell, `assetft` module interacts with `wbank` which in turn wraps the original `bank`
module.

## Token Interactions

### Issue

Coreum provides a decentralized platform which allows everyone to tokenize their assets. Although
the functionality of fungible token creation and minting is present in the original `bank` module of
Cosmos SDK, it is not exposed to end users, and it is only possible to create new fungible tokens
via either the governance or IBC. The Issue method described here, makes it possible for everyone to
create a fungible token and manage its supply. When the admin (issuer of the token) issues a token,
they specify the initial total supply which will be delivered to the admin account address.

All the information provided at the time of issuance is immutable and cannot be changed later.

#### Denom naming, Symbol and Precision

The way that denom is created is that the user provides a name for their subunit, and the denom for
the token, which is the main identifier of the token, will be created by joining the subunit and the
issuer address separated with a dash (subunit-address). The user also provides the symbol and
precision which will only be used for display purposes and will be stored in the bank module's
metadata field.

For example to represent Bitcoin on Coreum, one could choose satoshi as subunit, BTC as Symbol and 8
as precision. It means that if the issuer address is core1tr3w86yesnj8f290l6ve02cqhae8x4ze0nk0a8
then the denom will be `satoshi-core1tr3w86yesnj8f290l6ve02cqhae8x4ze0nk0a8` and since we have
chosen BTC as symbol and 8 as precision, it will follow that (1 BTC = 10^8
`satoshi-devcore1tr3w86yesnj8f290l6ve02cqhae8x4ze0nk0a8`)

#### Token Features

When issuing a token, the admin must decide which features are enabled on the token. For example if
`minting` feature is enabled then it will allow the admin to mint further tokens on top of the
initial supply, otherwise no new tokens can be minted. Here is a list of all the features that can
be enabled on the token. Each of these features affects how the token will behave and a detailed
description will be provided in the dedicated section for each feature.

-   minting
-   burning
-   freezing
-   whitelisting
-   ibc
-   block smart contracts
-   clawback

#### Burn Rate

The admin has the option to provide `BurnRate` when issuing a new token. This value is a number
between 0 and 1, and if it is above zero, in every transfer, some additional tokens will be burnt on
top of the transferred value, from the senders address. The tokens to be burnt are calculated by
multiplying the TransferAmount by burn rate, and rounding it up to an integer value.

If IBC feature is enabled for the token then the burn rate is applied to outgoing IBC transfers.

Burn rate is never applied if smart contract is the sender.

#### Send Commission Rate

Exactly same as the Burn Rate, but the calculated value will be transferred to the admin account
addressed instead of being burnt.

If IBC feature is enabled for the token then the send commission rate is applied to outgoing IBC
transfers.

Send commission rate is never applied if smart contract is the sender.

#### Issuance Fee

Whenever a user wants to issue a fungible token, they have to pay some extra money as issuance fee,
which is calculated on top of tx execution fee and will be burnt. The amount of the issuance fee is
controlled by governance.

### Mint

If the minting feature is enabled, then admin of the token can submit a Mint transaction to add
more tokens to the total supply. All the minted tokens will be transferred to the admin account
address.

### Burn

The admin of the token can burn the tokens that they hold. If the burning feature is enabled, then
every holder of the token can burn the tokens they hold.

### Freeze/Unfreeze

If the freezing feature is enabled on a token, then the admin of the token can freeze an account up
to an amount. The frozen amount can be more than what the user currently holds, an works even if the
user holds zero. The user can only send the tokens that they hold in excess of the frozen amount.
For example if the admin freezes 1000 ABC tokens on account Y and this account holds 800, then they
cannot move any of their tokens, but if the account receives 400 extra ABC tokens, their total
balance will become 1200 and then can only spend 200 of it, since 1000 is Frozen.

Here is the description of behavior of the freezing feature:

-   The admin can freeze an account up to a specific amount if the freezing feature is enabled.
-   The admin can increase the frozen amount by submitting a new freeze transaction on top of
    already frozen account. The frozen amount of the account will be increased by the new value.
-   The admin can unfreeze a portion of the frozen amount on an account.
-   The admin cannot freeze their own account
-   The user can only send their tokens in excess of the frozen amount.
-   The user can receive tokens regardless of frozen limitation.
-   The user cannot burn the frozen amount if both freezing and burning is enabled.
-   Frozen amount cannot be a negative value, it means that amount present in unfreeze transaction
    cannot be bigger than the current frozen amount
-   If either or both of BurnRate and SendCommissionRate are set above zero, then after transfer has
    taken place and those rates are applied, the sender's balance must not go below the frozen
    amount. Otherwise the transaction will fail.

Same rules apply to sending tokens over IBC transfer protocol if IBC is enabled for the token.

### Global Freeze/Unfreeze

If the freezing feature is enabled on a token, then the admin of the token can globally freeze that
token, which means that nobody except the admin can send that token. In other words, only the
admin will be able to send to other accounts. The admin can also globally unfreeze and remove this
limitation.

If IBC is enabled for the token and token is globally frozen then only the admin can send them over
IBC transfer protocol.

### Whitelist

If the whitelisting feature is enabled, then every account that wishes to receive this token, must
first be whitelisted by the admin, otherwise they will not be able to receive that token. This
feature allows the admin to set whitelisted limit on any account, and then that account will be
able to receive tokens only up to the whitelisted limit. If someone tries to send tokens to an
account which will result in the whitelisted amount to be exceeded, the transaction will fail.

Here is the description of behavior of the whitelisting feature:

-   The admin can set whitelisted limit on any account except their own.
-   The admin can set whitelisted amount higher or lower than what the user currently holds.
-   The admin account is whitelisted to infinity by default and cannot be modified.
-   The user can receive tokens as long as their total balance, after the transaction execution,
    will not be higher than their whitelisted amount

Same rules apply to receiving tokens over IBC transfer protocol if IBC is enabled for the token.

### Unlimited freezing and whitelisting

When admin wants to freeze or whitelist account, the exact amount to whitelist or freeze must be provided. We don't support separate message types which might be used to freeze or whitelist unlimited amounts.

If admin needs that functionality, here is the procedure for achieving this goal:
1. Check what the total supply of the token is
2. Whitelist or freeze amount greater than or equal to that total supply.

Keep in mind that admin must plan for eventual total supply changes caused by minting.

### IBC
When token is created, admin decides if users may send and receive it over IBC transfer protocol.
If IBC feature is disabled token can never leave the Coreum chain.

### Block Smart Contracts

When token is created, admin decides if users may send it to smart contracts or not. If this
feature is enabled, then the token can only be sent to regular user addresses. It's important to
point out that this doesn't mean that the token cannot be issued from a smart contract. If the token
with this feature enabled is issued from a smart contract, it can be sent back to this contract, but
it cannot be sent to any other smart contract.

### Clawback
If the clawback feature is enabled on a token, then the admin of the token can confiscate up to the
amount an account holds. The clawback amount cannot be more than what the user currently holds.

Here is the description of behavior of the clawback feature:
- The admin can clawback up to the amount an account holds if the clawback feature is enabled.
- The admin cannot clawback from their own account
- The admin cannot clawback from module accounts

Same rules apply to sending tokens over IBC transfer protocol if IBC is enabled for the token.

_**Disclaimer**: if the admin claws back from the escrow address, then it will break the IBC. admins
should not do this if they want the IBC to work for their token._
