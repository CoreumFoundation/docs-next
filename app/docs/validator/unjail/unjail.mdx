# How to unjail the validator

## Check the reason for jailing:
- `cored q slashing signing-infos`  will show us the status of all validators,
  where you can see the jailed one and check the reason.
- If the validator is jailed for being offline, there is reasonable `jailed_until`  time, and `tombstoned`  is set to false. You can unjail it.
- If the validator is jailed for double signing, it means there are two replicas with the same `priv_validator_key.json` file.
  In this case, one will be tombstoned with`jailed_until` 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z, and `tombstoned`  is set to true.
  It means that [**there is no way to unjail the tombstoned validator**](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/can-i-unjail-validator-who-jailed-by-doublesign/7830)
  Another replica is jailed with reasonable `jailed_until`  time and `tombstoned`  is set to false. You can unjail it.

## Unjail validator
If the validator is jailed but not tombstoned, the next steps will unjail it:
1. Fix the reason for jailing.
2. Send unjail transaction on behalf of the stalker account who owns the validator:
```
cored tx slashing unjail --from {VALIDATOR_ONWER_ACCOUNT}
# where VALIDATOR_ONWER_ACCOUNT - Name or address of the account to sign the transaction
```

* (Optional) Check the validator's state
  If your validator is up and running, you can check its state by sending the next command:
    ```bash
    cored status --node={YOUR_RPC_ADDRESS}
    # where YOUR_RPC_ADDRESS is your validator public http address
    ```
