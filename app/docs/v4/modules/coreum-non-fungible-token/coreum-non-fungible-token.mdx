# Coreum Non-Fungible Token

This document specifies `assetnft` module, which allows public users of the blockchain to create
non-fungible tokens on the Coreum blockchain.

# Concepts

This module provides transactions and queries which allows public users of the blockchain to issue
non-fungible tokens. The information for the NFTs themselves are stored in the `nft` module
developed by Cosmos team, but that module does not allow public users to issue NFT classes or mint
NFTs, and that's where this module comes in. The interaction between the two modules is described
[here](#interaction-with-nft-module-introducing-wnft-module). This module also introduces `features`
that defines specific behavior for the nft (described [here](#token-features)).

## Interaction with nft module, introducing wnft module

The Cosmos team has developed the `nft` module (which we hereby refer to as the
`original nft module`), which can be used to store the information about NFTs, their classes, their
ownership, etc. But as mentioned earlier this module does not provide any functionalities to public
users to create their own NFTs, or define custom behavior for transferring tokens. Because of this
reason we have wrapped the `original nft module` into the `wnft` module, which allows injecting
custom logic into the transfer method of the `original nft module`. We have also created the
`assetnft` module (this module), to allow public users to create their own NFTs with their own
custom behavior.

In other words the `assetnft` module defines the custom behavior for NFTs, enforces that behavior by
injecting custom logic into `wnft` module, and keeps most NFT related information on the
`original nft module`.

This design means that some portion of data relating to NFTs will live in this module, and some will
live in the `original nft module`, so to get the final NFT functionality one should be aware and
understand that they should make some of the queries to the `original nft module`.

## Token Features

NFT tokens come with a set of features that the issuer can specify at the time of issuing a class,
and then in some cases configured on each NFT level later.

Here is the list of features:

-   minting
-   burning
-   freezing
-   whitelisting
-   disable sending
-   soulbound
-   update data 

We will discuss each feature separately.

### Minting
The minting is enabled for all issued NFT classes. The minting allows to mint a token for an NFT class by the issuer of the class.
There are two data types that can be used for NFT minting `DataBytes` and `DataDynamic`. The `DataBytes` contains immutable data bytes
array. The `DataDynamic` contains the list of the `DataDynamicItem` which can be updated depending on item's `editors`. 
Currently supported `DataEditors` are  `admin` and `owner`. If only one editor is set for the item, only that editor can update the 
item's `data` using the`MsgUpdateData`. If both, both can update the `data`. If the `editors` list is empty no one can update the `data`.

### Burning

If this feature is enabled, it allows the holders of the token to burn the tokens they hold. It
should be noted here that the issuer can burn their token regardless of this feature.

### Freezing

If this feature is enabled, it allows the issuer of the class to freeze any NFT token in that class.
A frozen token cannot be transferred until it is unfrozen by the issuer.

### Whitelisting

If this feature is enabled, then for any user to receive any NFT of that class, they must be
whitelisted to receive that specific NFT. It follows that this feature allows the issuer of the
class to whitelist an account to hold a specific NFT of that class, or remove an account from
whitelisted accounts for that NFT.

### Disable Sending

If this feature is enabled, then the NFT cannot be directly transferred between users, meaning that
user A cannot send the tokens they hold directly to user B. This feature opens up the door for
different use cases in the future, one of which is that it might be used to force transfer of
ownership to go via DEX, so that the royalty fee is applied and the creator of the NFT always gets a
royalty fee.

### Soulbound

If this feature is enabled, then the NFT can not be sent by anyone, except the issuer. This feature
is useful for NFTs that are created for a specific user, and the issuer wants to make sure that the
NFT is not transferred to anyone else.

## Update Data
