# Troubleshooting

## Network connection

Ensure that your Node is visible by the other nodes within the network.

You can check it by sending ping message from your local machine.
```bash
ping YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_IP
```

## Error parsing app.toml

If your `crudini` version is below 0.9.3, you might face the following issue:
```bash
Error parsing ~/.core/coreum-mainnet-1/config/app.toml: File contains parsing errors: <???>
[line 104]: ]
```
Please update your crudini version to 0.9.3 or open app.toml and replace next lines:
```bash
global-labels = [
]
```
with
```bash
global-labels = []
```

## Validator missing blocks

In order to check your validators uptime you can use the following resources:

- [Validators.info](https://validator.info/coreum)
- [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/coreum/validators?sector=uptime)


You should aim for your validator to have < 95% uptime. In case your validator has > 95% uptime you should
check the following:

- Check if your validator machine has enough resources according to the following [doc](/docs/v4/nodes-and-validators/essentials/system-requirements)
  You should make sure that your machine uses NVMe SSD disk.
- Check if your storage solution is fast enough. Install `htop` application on your server and check if a lot of time is spent
  doing `iowait` operations. If so, you should consider upgrading your storage solution.
