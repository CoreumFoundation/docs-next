# Special Addresses

Special addresses are addresses that have a special function or purpose in the Coreum blockchain and
are not controlled by any particular account. These addresses are used for various purposes such as
the community pool, IBC escrow, and module accounts. Here we list the most important special
addresses of the Coreum blockchain.

## Module Accounts

In the Cosmos SDK, each module has a module account with an address that has no private key and
therefore is only controlled by the chain itself and governance. Here we list all the module
accounts of the Coreum blockchain.

| Module         | Name                | Address                                       | String                     |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |

## Community Pool

The community pool is a special account that holds funds that are not owned by any particular
account. It is used to fund public goods and other community initiatives. The community pool is
controlled by governance, which means that proposals must be submitted and voted on by token holders
to spend funds from the community pool. The community pool receives a portion of the staking rewards
and transaction fees. Currently, the commuinity tax is set to 5%.

The community pool address is the same as the distribution module account address:
`core1jv65s3grqf6v6jl3dp4t6c9t9rk99cd853u8wy`, which also contains other amounts such as uncollected
staking rewards. To obtain the exact amount in the community pool, you can query the distribution
module account as follows:

```bash
cored q distribution community-pool $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS $COREUM_NODE_ARGS
```

## IBC Escrow Addresses

The IBC module uses an escrow address for each channel and port id that holds tokens when they are
IBCed from the Coreum blockchain to another chain. Once these tokens are bridged back to Coreum,
these tokens are sent back to the recipient address from this escrow address

Here is an example of IBC escrow address is `core12k2pyuylm9t7ugdvz67h9pg4gmmvhn5vvgafk0`, which
belongs to the IBC channel `channel-2` and port `transfer` that connects Coreum to Osmosis.
