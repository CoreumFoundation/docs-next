# Transfer funds with CLI

The section provides a tutorial on how to use `cored` cli. You can follow this flow with any other
cli command.

**Note:** we are going to use testnet for this example.

-   [Install cored binary](/docs/become-validator/essentials/install-cored)

-   Point `cored` binary to testnet network:

```bash
export CORED_NODE=https://full-node.testnet-1.coreum.dev:26657
export CHAIN_ID="coreum-testnet-1"
```

If you want to target other network than testnet, replace it with values at [network variables page](/docs/tutorials/get-started/setup-cli)

  * To check verify that everything is set correctly, you can run `cored status | jq` and check network name.
    If you don't have jq installed you can run `cored status`, but we strongly recommend using this awesome tool :)

* You should have funded account. If you don't have it, do next:
  * Go to [faucet page](/docs/tools/faucet) and click `Generate Funded Wallet`.
  * Copy `Wallet Mnemonic` and go to your terminal and run:
  ```bash
  cored keys add my-sender-wallet --recover --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID
  # Where `my-sender-wallet` is your local account name. It will be used later.
  ```
  * Enter your mnemonic. Now you imported account into your local machine!
  * Store the mnemonic in safe place, this is the only way to recover your account.

* Transfer funds. Let's go step by step, `--help` command will lead us through:
  * Let's check available commands for `cored`:
    ```bash
    cored --help
    ```
  * Sending funds changes the state of the network, so this is a transaction. Let's check modules that has own transactions:
    ```bash
    cored tx --help
    ```

  * `bank` module is responsible for transferring funds:

        ```bash
        cored tx bank --help
        ```

    -   There is only one available command called `send`. Let's check its usage:

        ```bash
        cored tx bank send --help
        # output:
        # cored tx bank send [from_key_or_address] [to_address] [amount] [flags]
        ```

    -   Full command should look like this:

        ```bash
        cored tx bank send my-sender-wallet testcore1snn05vrzvnwy7t0g00rr7hva63hmwxuuv7nrj0 1000000utestcore --node=$CORED_NODE --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID
        # my-sender-wallet is your local account name, which can be replaced by an address.
        # 1000000utestcore is equal to 1testcore
        ```

    -   If the output code is 0, get the transaction hash, go to
        [Block Explorer](/docs/tools/blockchain-explorers) and put it into the search line.

        If output code is not 0, your transaction failed local validation and was not broadcasted.
        Fix the problem and run the command again.

## Send staking tx with CLI

-   To stake your tokens with CLI you should use `staking` module. Let's check available commands:

    ```bash
    cored tx staking --help
    # create-validator create new validator initialized with a self-delegation to it
    # delegate         Delegate liquid tokens to a validator
    # edit-validator   edit an existing validator account
    # redelegate       Redelegate illiquid tokens from one validator to another
    # unbond           Unbond shares from a validator
    ```

-   Let's delegate some tokens:
    ```bash
    cored tx bank send my-sender-wallet testcore1snn05vrzvnwy7t0g00rr7hva63hmwxuuv7nrj0 1000000utestcore --node=$CORED_NODE --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID
    # my-sender-wallet is your local account name, which can be replaced by an address.
    # 1000000utestcore is equal to 1testcore
    ```

  * If the output code is 0, get the transaction hash, go to [Block Explorer](/docs/tools/blockchain-explorers) and put it into the search line.

    If output code is not 0, your transaction failed local validation and was not broadcasted. Fix the problem and run the command again.

  # unbond           Unbond shares from a validator
  ```

* Let's delegate some tokens:
  ```bash
  # cored tx staking delegate [validator-addr] [amount] --from [delegator-addr] [flags]
  cored tx staking delegate testcorevaloper14x4ux30sadvg90k2xd8fte5vnhhh0uvkxf4rgm 1000000utestcore --from testcore1q07ldrjnr8xtsy3rz82yxqcdrffu3uw3daslrw --node=$CORED_NODE --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID
  # 1000000utestcore is equal to 1testcore
  ```
