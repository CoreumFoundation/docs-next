# Install cored

This document provides the instruction on how to install the release binaries of the `cored`.

Choose preferred way to install `cored`:

1. [Install prebuilt **cored** (for linux OS only)](#install-prebuilt-cored)
2. [Build from sources](#build-from-sources)

## Install prebuilt `cored`

Note: this option supports linux OS only. Also, it should be used in case you interact with the chain with the CLI only.

* Verify that [network variables](/docs/v4/tutorials/get-started/setup-cli) are set up correctly.

* Create a proper folder structure for `cored`.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p $COREUM_HOME/bin
    ```

* Install the required util: `curl`.

* Download `cored` and put it in the required folder.

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases/download/$COREUM_VERSION/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME
    mv $COREUM_BINARY_NAME $COREUM_HOME/bin/cored
    ```
* * If you are getting 404 error at this step, run:
    ```bash
    echo https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases/download/$COREUM_VERSION/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME
    ```
    And check if it generates a right link. It should lead to one of our <a href="https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#25D695] hover:opacity-80 text-base font-bold">releases</a>.
    If it doesn't - double-check your network variables.

* Add `cored` to PATH and make it executable.

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:$COREUM_HOME/bin
    chmod +x $COREUM_HOME/bin/*
    ```

  **Attention!** *Set this variable globally so it will be automatically set after starting a new terminal session.*

* Test `cored`.

    ```bash
    cored version
    ```

That's it, you have cored installed! You can return to previous Readme.
