## Setup CLI Network variables

This document describes the command to set up the environment depending on the type of network you
want to use.

- ⚠️ Keep in mind, that the Public RPC Node is stable, but there is always a risk of DDoS attacks,
  and if you build your own product(wallet, etc), it is recommended to rely on your own RPC Node.
- ⚠️ Also, having own RPC node is recommended if you frequently query

- Set the env variables with the values corresponding to the network you want to connect to, from
  the table above.

```bash
  export COREUM_CHAIN_ID={Coreum chain id}
  export COREUM_GRPC_URL={Coreum GRPC URL}
  export XRPL_RPC_URL={XRPL RPC URL}
  export COREUMBRIDGE_XRPL_VERSION={Bridge release version}
  export COREUMBRIDGE_XRPL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS={Contract address}
```

**Attention!** _Set those variables globally so it is automatically set after starting a new
terminal session._

## Setup Docker

For the simplicity we use the alias for the command which will be executed in docker. Pay attention
that all files outputs are related to docker container.

```bash
alias coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer="docker run -e HOME=/root -it --rm -v $HOME/.coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer:/root/.coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer coreumfoundation/coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer:$COREUMBRIDGE_XRPL_VERSION"
```

We expect that the command will be executed from the `root` user, since the container will generate
the files, and if the user is not `root` those files will be allowed to be modified by the `root`
only. If you do not want to use root user you would need to either generate the file inside the
container without mounting it and copying it outside. Or generate them first and then allow from
`root` to the current user to modify them or use the binary for the file generation. Pay attention
that keys are encrypted files as well.
