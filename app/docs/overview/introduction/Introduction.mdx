# Introduction

<a className="text-[#25D695] hover:opacity-80 font-bold" href="https://analytics.smartstake.io/coreum" target="_blank" href="https://coreum.com">Coreum</a> is a 3rd-generation layer-1 enterprise-grade blockchain built to serve
as a core infrastructure for decentralized applications with ISO20022 compatibility, IBC
interoperability, and novel <a className="text-[#25D695] hover:opacity-80 font-bold" href="https://analytics.smartstake.io/coreum" target="_blank" href="https://www.coreum.com/smart-tokens">Smart Tokens</a>.

Coreum network guarantees elevated throughput, cost-effective fees, and unparalleled scalability.
WASM-based smart contracts enable diverse use cases, while the low-latency, PoS network propels
rapid, secure, and modular applications, expediting decentralized tech adoption in large-scale
organizations.

**$COREUM** is the native token for Coreum, and is used for interacting with the blockchain's various
features, from the consensus protocol, to the decentralised exchange, and so on.

An established usecase for a network like Coreum is the
<a className="text-[#25D695] hover:opacity-80 font-bold" href="https://sologenic.com" target="_blank">Sologenic Ecosystem</a>, which currently resides on the XRP Ledger.

Coreum is fast, low cost, and environmentally friendly. By leveraging a Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS)
consensus mechanism, Coreum is not subject to the high energy costs that other blockchains are
criticised for. Furthermore, Coreum's scalability and throughput ensure that the operation of the
network does not incur the exorbitant fees that hinder other blockchains.

## Features

The ecosystem natively supports next features:

### Smart contracts

A Smart Contract is an executable piece of code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate,
execute and enforce an agreement between parties without the involvement of a trusted third party.

Coreum provides Smart Contracts functionality, more details you can find at
[Smart Contracts page](/docs/overview/smart-contracts)

### Smart tokens

Except for the native token **$COREUM**, the Coreum Network also provides the ability to create custom tokens with these features:

-   Issuance (Minting)
-   Access Control List (ACL)
-   Burning
-   Freezing and Global Freezing
-   Whitelisting
-   Burn Rate
-   Clawback
-   Commission Rate
-   IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) compatibility
-   Smart Contract integration

More details you can find at [Smart Tokens page](/docs/overview/smart-tokens)

### Fee Model

Coreum's Fee Model introduces few novel ideas into the Cosmos Ecosystem, which makes the chain more
resilient to load pikes and also makes it simpler to interact with the chain.

-   Gas is deterministic for most of the transaction types. For example, if you want to transfer
    tokens, you know how gas amount you need, without interacting with the chain in any way.
-   The gas price is determined based on the load on the system. This module is responsible for
    calculating minimum gas price required by the chain based on the parameters of Fee Model.

More details you can find at [Fee Model page](/docs/modules/coreum-fee-model)

### Decentralised Exchange (DEX)

The DEX supports the trading of $COREUM, as well as any issued assets found on Coreum.

The DEX is native to the blockchain, enabling low-fee, secure, and fast trading activities.

Moreover, any user is able to trade assets by choosing any trading pair.

Check Coreum's Roadmap for DEX release date.

### Bridges

Bridges or Cross-chain crypto bridges are applications that enable the transfer of assets between
different blockchains.

Coreum has Decentralized Bridge, which is provided by IBC, and Centralized Bridge, which is handled
by Coreum.
