# IBC Transfer to Osmosis Using Keplr Wallet

This guide walks you through the steps involved in sending an IBC transfer to osmosis using the
Keplr wallet.

## 1. Open Keplr Wallet

    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/keplr_open.png" alt="Open Keplr Wallet" />
</center>

Start by opening your Keplr wallet. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the
browser extension store.

## 2. Navigate to Advanced IBC Transaction

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/advanced_ibc_transfer.png" alt="Navigate to Advanced IBC Transaction" />
</center>

In your Keplr wallet, navigate to the section where you can initiate an advanced IBC transaction.

`Note:` If you do not have "Developer Mode" enabled on your Keplr Wallet, you will not see this
option. To enable developer mode, go to Settings -> Advanced, and enabled "Developer Mode".

## 3. Select Asset

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/select_asset.png" alt="Select Asset" />
</center>

Choose the asset/token you want to transfer. Ensure you have sufficient balance for the transfer.

## 4. Choose Destination Chain

### Adding IBC Transfer Channel in Keplr

You must first add the IBC Transfer Channel to Keplr. When you click on destination chain, you will
see "Add New IBC Tranfer Channel", with a "+" icon. Choose the relevant destination chain.

    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/new_ibc_transfer_channel.png" alt="New IBC Transfer Channel" />
</center>

Next, you can add an IBC Channel, and the corresponding `Source Channel ID`

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/add_ibc_channel.png" alt="Add IBC Channel" />
</center>

You can find the relevant Configurations for Coreum here:

-   [Coreum IBC Channels](/docs/tutorials/ibc/ibc-channels)

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/choose_destination_chain.png" alt="Choose Destination Chain" />
</center>

Select the blockchain where you want to send the asset. This is the receiving chain of the IBC
transfer.

`Note:` This will be blank if the channel-id has not been registered in the IBC Chain Registry, and
correctly opened by the relayer.

## 5. Enter Wallet Address

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/wallet_address.png" alt="Enter Wallet Address" />
</center>

Provide the address of the recipient's wallet on the destination chain.

## 6. Enter Amount

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/amount.png" alt="Enter Amount" />
</center>

Specify the amount of the asset you wish to transfer. Ensure you account for any transaction fees.

## 7. Review Transaction

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/confirm_transaction.png" alt="Confirm Transaction" />
</center>

Review all the details of the transfer. Ensure everything looks correct before proceeding.

### 7a. Confirm Transaction Details

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/confirm_transaction2.png" alt="Confirm Transaction Details" />
</center>

Keplr might ask you to confirm the transaction details once more. Double-check and proceed.

### 7b. Approve Transaction

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/confirm_data.png" alt="Confirm Data" />
</center>

Ensure all transaction data is correct. This includes the amount, destination address, and asset
type.

## 10. Final Transaction Confirmation

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/confirm_transaction3.png" alt="Final Transaction Confirmation" />
</center>

Before the transaction is broadcasted, confirm it for the last time. This is the final step before
the transaction is sent to the network.

## 11. Transaction Explorer

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/transaction_explorer.png" alt="Transaction Explorer" />
</center>

Once the transaction is confirmed, you can view it on Coreum's blockchain explorer.

`Note: ` Tt's essential to understand that IBC transactions might not be instantaneous. There's a
brief delay between sending the transaction from the source chain and receiving it on the
destination chain. Additionally, if a transaction timeouts for any reason, this will be visible on
the source chain, not the destination chain. Always monitor the source chain's explorer for any
timeout or error messages related to your IBC transaction.

## 12. Transaction Hash

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/transaction_hash.png" alt="Transaction Hash" />
</center>

This is the unique identifier for your transaction. You can use it to track the status of your
transfer.

## 13. Explorer Transaction Messages

<center className="w-full md:w-1/3 max-w-full mt-2 mb-6">
    <img src="/images/tutorials/ibc/ibc-transfer-to-osmosis/explorer_tx_messages.png" alt="Explorer Transaction Messages" />
</center>

In the blockchain explorer, you can see detailed messages associated with your transaction,
including confirmations from validators and more.

```

## 14. Verify Successful Transfer to Osmosis

Now we can see our tokens have arrived, and are named "CORE on Osmosis", and have an IBC label.

By following these steps, you should successfully send an IBC transfer to osmosis using the Keplr
wallet on Coreum. Remember to always double-check details before confirming transactions to ensure
the security and accuracy of your transfers.
