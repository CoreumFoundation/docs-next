# Testing multiple contracts

The tutorial provides an example of how to test a contract workspace, where we have multi-contract
interactions, using the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-multi-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#24cc8e] hover:text-[#1db07a] text-md font-bold">CosmWasm multitest library</a>


## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need to:

-   Install <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#24cc8e] hover:text-[#1db07a] text-md font-bold">rust and cargo</a>
-   Be familiar with the Rust programming language.

## Getting Started

-   Clone the repository workspace.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CoreumFoundation/secure-messaging-poc.git
```

The structure of the workspace is the following:

```bash
├── contracts
│   ├── controller
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── messages
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── profiles
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src
│   │       └── ...
├── packages
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src
│   │       └── ...
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
```

As you can see, we have three contracts (controller, messages and profiles) and a package utils that
contains code shared by multiple contracts. Since the controller contract is in charge of
interacting with the messages and profiles contracts we are going to keep our integration tests
there.

-   Define dev dependencies.

Since we are going to keep our tests under the controller contract, we are going to define
cw-multi-test in the Cargo.toml of the controller contract. We will also use some elements of the
other contracts so we will include those contracts in our dev dependencies as well. These dependencies are only used for tests.

```rust
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "0.16.5"
profiles = { path = "../profiles" }
messages = { path = "../messages" }
```

-   Let's take a look now at how we can write the integration tests.

1. We create a wrapper around our contracts that we will use to store the code.

```rust
fn controller_contract() -> Box<dyn Contract<Empty>> {
    let contract = ContractWrapper::new(execute, instantiate, query).with_reply(reply);
    Box::new(contract)
}

fn profiles_contract() -> Box<dyn Contract<Empty>> {
    let contract = ContractWrapper::new(profilesExecute, profilesInstantiate, profilesQuery);
    Box::new(contract)
}

fn messages_contract() -> Box<dyn Contract<Empty>> {
    let contract = ContractWrapper::new(messagesExecute, messagesInstantiate, messagesQuery);
    Box::new(contract)
}
```

In the case of our controller contract, we have a reply entry point so we need to add that as well.
In the case that, for example, there was a migrate or a sudo entry point we would need to add it in
the same way.

2. We initialize our test App (which will simulate the blockchain).

For some tests we don't need to use balances so we simply use:

```rust
let mut app = App::default();
```

In the case that we need to initialize some values we can use AppBuilder that will set our
parametres. In this example we initialize the balance of an account:

```rust
    let admin = Addr::unchecked("admin");
    let mut app = AppBuilder::new().build(|router, _api, storage| {
        router
            .bank
            .init_balance(storage, &admin, coins(10000, DENOM))
            .unwrap();
    });
```

This will initialize our test App initializing the balance of an admin address with 10000 ucore.

3. Store the contracts so that we can interact with them.

```rust
    let code_id_controller = app.store_code(controller_contract());
    let code_id_profiles = app.store_code(profiles_contract());
    let code_id_messages = app.store_code(messages_contract());
```

Using our previously created App, we can store the contracts that we want and obtain their code_id to initialize them.

4. Now that we have our contracts stored, we can interact with them. For example, we can instantiate our controller contract.

```rust
let contract_addr = app
        .instantiate_contract(
            code_id_controller,
            admin,
            &ControllerInstantiateMsg {
                code_id_profiles,
                code_id_messages,
                message_max_len: 5000,
                message_query_default_limit: 50,
                message_query_max_limit: 500,
                create_profile_cost: Some(coin(100, DENOM)),
                send_message_cost: Some(coin(10, DENOM)),
            },
            &[],
            "Controller",
            None,
        )
        .unwrap();
```

Since our controller contract also instantiates a profiles and a messages contract (that's why we provide the other code_ids in the message), we only need to instantiate this one.

5. Query any of our contracts providing their contract address.

```rust
let resp: Config = app
        .wrap()
        .query_wasm_smart(contract_addr, &ControllerQueryMsg::Config {})
        .unwrap();
```

In this example, we query the Config of our controller by querying it.

Since our controller contract also contains the contract addresses of the profiles and messages contract, we can obtain these addresses to query them. Example:

```rust
let resp: ContractAddressesResponse = app
        .wrap()
        .query_wasm_smart(contract_addr, &ControllerQueryMsg::ContractAddresses {})
        .unwrap();

let resp_profiles: ProfileInfo = app
        .wrap()
        .query_wasm_smart(
            resp.profiles_contract_addr,
            &ProfilesQueryMsg::AddressInfo { address: admin },
        )
        .unwrap();
```

As you can see, we first obtain the contract address of the profiles contract and then we directly query that contract to obtain the user id of a specific address.

6. Execute a contract.

```rust
    let msg_create_profile = &ControllerExecuteMsg::CreateProfile {
        user_id: "myuser".to_owned(),
        pubkey: "mypubkey".to_owned(),
    };

    let send_funds = coins(100, DENOM);

    app.execute_contract(
        admin.clone(),
        contract_addr.clone(),
        msg_create_profile,
        &send_funds,
    )
    .unwrap();
```

In this example we create a profile providing the message to the controller contract and attaching funds to it.

* Write and run our tests:

With all these tools we can write all the tests that we deem necessary and tests our contracts in an easy and convenient way.

By simply running 

```bash
cargo test
```
or
```bash
cargo test --package controller
```

we can test all our integration tests. The first command will run all the tests in all the contracts, but since we only have tests in our controller contract, we can indicate to package where the tests are located so that our output only shows what we want.

## Build all the contracts

Since we have a workspace with multiple contracts instead of a single contract, we can utilize the workspace optimizer that will compile and optimize all our contracts and put them in the /artifacts folder.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.15.0
```
