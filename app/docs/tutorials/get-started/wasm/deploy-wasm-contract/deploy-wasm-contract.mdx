# Deploy first WASM contract

The tutorial provides example on how to use the `CosmJS` package to instantiate, execute and query CosmWASM Smart Contracts deployed on the Coreum blockchain.

## What Is CosmWasm?

CosmWasm is a smart contract platform that allows for the development and execution of smart contracts on blockchains that are built using the Cosmos SDK. It is designed to enhance the Cosmos ecosystem by providing a powerful and flexible way to create decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact across different blockchains within the Cosmos network. Here's an in-depth look at its features, architecture, and how it works:

1. Multi-chain Compatibility: CosmWasm contracts can run on any blockchain that integrates the CosmWasm module, enabling developers to write a contract once and deploy it across multiple chains in the Cosmos ecosystem.

2. Language Support: It allows developers to write smart contracts in Rust, a memory-safe, and high-performance programming language. This choice provides developers with the tools to write secure and efficient code.

3. IBC Integration: CosmWasm supports the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, enabling smart contracts to send and receive messages across different blockchains in the Cosmos network, facilitating true interoperability.

4. Customizable: Blockchains can customize the CosmWasm module to fit their specific needs, making it a flexible solution for a wide range of applications.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need to:

* Install [rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
* Be familiar with the Rust programming language.
* Have a general understanding of how the Coreum blockchain works.
* Follow the [instruction](cored.md) to install cored binary.
* Install the required util: `jq`.
* Set the [network variables](network-variables.md) for the development (testnet is preferable).

# Source Code

The complete source code is
located [here](https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/cw-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nameservice).

# Getting Started

* Generate a new wallet for testing.

```bash
cored keys add wallet $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

* Use the [faucet](../tools-ecosystem/faucet.md) to fund your account

* Clone the smart contract template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/cw-contracts.git
```

* Go to the template directory.

```bash
cd cw-contracts/contracts/nameservice
```

# Build contract

* Build optimized WASM smart contract:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.15.0
```

This operation might take a significant amount of time.

*
    * If you get a following error:

```bash
error: could not find `Cargo.toml` in `/code` or any parent directory
```

Check if you are in a right directory (should be `cw-contracts/contracts/nameservice`)

# Deploy contract

* List the already deployed contract codes.

```bash
cored q wasm list-code $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

* Deploy the built artifact.

```bash
RES=$(cored tx wasm store artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm \
    --from wallet --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y -b block --output json $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS)
echo $RES    
CODE_ID=$(echo $RES | jq -r '.logs[0].events[-1].attributes[-1].value')
echo $CODE_ID
```

[//]: # (Error: strconv.ParseUint: parsing "f388fff922ffbb3845311608887636346eac6246ee20578e11e3577226466e7b": invalid syntax)

* Check the deployed code.

```bash
cored q wasm code-info $CODE_ID $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

# Instantiate contract

* Instantiating the contract.

```bash
INIT="{\"purchase_price\":{\"amount\":\"100\",\"denom\":\"$COREUM_DENOM\"},\"transfer_price\":{\"amount\":\"999\",\"denom\":\"$COREUM_DENOM\"}}"
cored tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID "$INIT" --from wallet --label "name service" -b block -y --no-admin $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

* Check the contract details and account balance.

```bash
cored q wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --output json $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=$(cored q wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --output json $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')
echo $CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

# Interact with the contract

* Register a name for the wallet address on the contract.

```bash
REGISTER='{"register":{"name":"fred"}}'
cored tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "$REGISTER" --amount 100$COREUM_DENOM --from wallet -b block -y $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

* Query the owner of the name record.

```bash
NAME_QUERY='{"resolve_record": {"name": "fred"}}'
cored q wasm contract-state smart $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "$NAME_QUERY" --output json $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

The owner is the "wallet" now.

* Transfer the ownership of the name record to "new-owner" wallet.

```bash
cored keys add new-owner $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=$(cored keys show --address new-owner $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS)
TRANSFER="{\"transfer\":{\"name\":\"fred\",\"to\":\"$RECIPIENT_ADDRESS\"}}"
cored tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "$TRANSFER" --amount 999$COREUM_DENOM --from wallet -b block -y $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
``` 

* Query the record owner again to see the new owner address.

```bash
echo "Recipient address: $RECIPIENT_ADDRESS"
NAME_QUERY='{"resolve_record": {"name": "fred"}}'
cored q wasm contract-state smart $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "$NAME_QUERY" --output json $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

# Next steps

* Read Coreum [modules](../modules/main.md) specification, to be familiar with the custom Coreum functionality you can
  use for your application.
* Read [WASM docs](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/) to understand all supported WASM features.
* Check other [tutorials](main.md) to find something you might be interested in additionally.
