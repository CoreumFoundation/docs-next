## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Initiation by Institution A**
Institution A, which could be a bank or another financial entity, initiates the process of sending a secure message, such as a payment instruction.

### 2. **Validate ISO 20022 Message**
Institution A validates the message against the ISO 20022 standard, a messaging standard that enables the electronic exchange of information in the financial industry.

### 3. **Encryption with Public Key B**
The validated message is encrypted using the public key of Institution B. This ensures that only Institution B, which possesses the corresponding private key, can decrypt the message.

### 4. **Smart Tokenization**
The message is tokenized into a smart token, turning sensitive data into a non-sensitive equivalent, known as a "token," that has no meaningful value outside its context.

### 5. **XML Declaration**
The structure of the message is based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language), commonly used for sharing data across systems.

### 6. **References and Syntax Rules**
The message includes references to previous transactions or relevant documents and adheres to specific syntax rules for proper structure and comprehension.

### 7. **Tags, Elements, and Attributes**
Within the XML:
- **Tags & Elements**: Define and organize the information hierarchically.
- **Attributes**: Provide additional details about the elements.

### 8. **Text Content**
This section contains the actual data within the XML elements.

### 9. **Receipt by Institution B**
Institution B receives and decrypts the message using its private key.

### 10. **Encrypt with Public Key A**
If Institution B needs to send a response or further information back to Institution A, it will encrypt this data with Institution A's public key.

### 11. **Decryption by Institution A**
Institution A then uses its private key to decrypt the message from Institution B.
