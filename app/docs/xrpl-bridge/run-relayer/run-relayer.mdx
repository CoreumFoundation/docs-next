# Run relayer

**Relayers** will facilitate communication between the two chains by connecting the multi-sig
account on the XRPL with the bridge smart contract on Coreum.

The relayer is sitting in between the two chains, between the multi-signing account on the XRPL and
the Bridge smart contract on the Coreum blockchain.

They are responsible for listening for events on both chains and trigger actions on the XRPL and
Coreum. Relayers are incentivized by receiving fees deducted from transactions.

**Minimum hardware setup requirements**:

-   e2 small machine type with 0.5 vCPU, 2GB of memory and 20BG of disk space (mostly for logs).

## Setup env variables and `coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer`

Pass the [doc](/docs/xrpl-bridge/install-relayer).

```bash
coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer init \
    --coreum-chain-id $COREUM_CHAIN_ID \
    --coreum-grpc-url $COREUM_GRPC_URL  \
    --xrpl-rpc-url $XRPL_RPC_URL \
    --coreum-contract-address $COREUMBRIDGE_XRPL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

## Generate the relayer keys

Generate new keys:

```bash
coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer coreum keys add coreum-relayer

coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer xrpl keys add xrpl-relayer
```

!!! Save output mnemonics to a safe place to be able to recover the relayer later. !!!

The `coreum-relayer` and `xrpl-relayer` are key names set by default in the `relayer.yaml`. If for
some reason you want to update them, then updated them in the `relayer.yaml` as well.

Or import the existing mnemonics:

```bash
coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer coreum keys add coreum-relayer --recover

coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer xrpl keys add xrpl-relayer --recover
```

## Extract keys info for the contract deployment

```bash
coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer relayer-keys
```

Output example:

```bash
Keys info
    coreumAddress: "testcore1lwzy78a7ulernmvdgvjyagaslsmp7x7g496jj4"
    xrplAddress: "r41Cc8WLZMeUvZfvB4Fc4hRjpHya4T4Nqq"
    xrplPubKey: "022ED182ACEBFE4C55CE0A0EA561468C31336F9B4E71FB487FC84D94A2826F1C10"
```

The output contains the `coreumAddress`, `xrplAddress` and `xrplPubKey` used for the contract
deployment.

Create the Coreum account on chain by sending some tokens to the `coreumAddress`. The ideal initial
amount for the relayer to operate properly is **100 COREUM**.

Do the same with the XRPL account by sending **10 XRP tokens** to the `xrplAddress` to activate it.
See <a href="https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/reserves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: '#24D494'}}>reserve requirements</a> for more information.


Once the accounts are created share the public keys info with Coreum foundation.

## Run

```bash
docker run -it --detach-keys="ctrl-c" --name coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer \
    -v $HOME/.coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer:/root/.coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer \
    coreumfoundation/coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer:$COREUMBRIDGE_XRPL_VERSION \
    start
```

Once you are attached, press any key and enter passwords for two keyrings after this, preses CTRL-c
to detach from the container. It is expected that at that time the relayer is initialized and its
keys are generated and accounts are funded.

When you run the relayer first time, and the keys are not included to the relayers set yet, you will
see errors in the logs such as `UnauthorizedSender`. It is expected, don't stop the relayer. Once
the relayer is included to the relayers set it will start relaying and no such error will be
printed.

If the relayer metrics are enabled, you also need to forward the metrics port (default 9090). To
enable them update the `$HOME/.coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer/relayer.yaml` config file and restart the
relayer.

## Restart running instance

```bash
docker stop coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer && docker rm coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer
```

Once the container is stopped and removed, proceed with the instructions in [run section](#run)

## Exposing relayer metrics

To expose metrics you need to change config located here `.coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer/relayer.yaml`
You need to change the following section:

```yaml
metrics:
    enabled: true
    server:
        listen_address: 0.0.0.0:10090 #specify the desired port to expose metrics
    periodic_collector:
        repeat_delay: 1m0s
```

After you've change the config you need to restart the bridge following [these instructions](#restart-running-instance)

Here's also an example of prometheus configuration to scrape bridge metrics:

```yaml
      - job_name: coreum-xrpl-mainnet-relayer
        honor_timestamps: true
        honor_labels: true
        scrape_interval: 5s
        scrape_timeout: 5s
        metrics_path: /metrics
        relabel_configs:
          - source_labels: [__address__]
            target_label: instance
            replacement: *your_relayer_instance_name*
        scheme: http
        static_configs:
          - targets:
              - *your_relayer_instance_ip*:10090
```
