# Asset Flow

The flow of assets for the bridge incurs in a decentralized and non-custodial mechanism.

## From XRPL to Coreum

1.  Users initiate a transfer by sending a payment transaction to the Multisig account on the XRPL,
    specifying issuer details, currency, amount, and the Coreum recipient's address.

2.  The relayer network continuously monitors for such transactions. Upon detecting one, the first
    relayer to do so channels the transaction, extracts its information, and submits proof to
    Coreum's Bridge Contract.

3.  The Bridge Contract then verifies the asset with Coreum's token registry and authorizes it for
    transfer.

4. For tokens originating from Coreum and Cosmos, the Bridge Contract directly dispatches the tokens to the recipient. In the case of XRPL-native tokens, the contract mints a <a href="https://www.coreum.com/smart-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#24D494] font-bold">Smart Token</a> on Coreum which is a representation of the original XRPL asset, equipped with Minting, Burning, and IBC functionalities. The token is then sent to the recipient.

## From the Coreum to XRPL

1.  Users initiate the transfer process and send tokens to the Bridge Contract on Coreum.
2.  A relayer then identifies this transaction, retrieves it, and forwards the details to the
    Multisig account on the XRPL.
3.  Finally, the Multisig account processes the transaction and delivers the tokens directly to the
    recipient's address on the XRPL.
