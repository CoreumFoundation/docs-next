## Prerequisites

-   Rust development environment
-   Coreum node running locally
-   Coreum CLI `cored` installed
-   Docker

## Contract Structure

The main contract code is in `contract.rs`, which uses `msg.rs` that defines our `ExecuteMsg` and
`InstantiateMsg`. It also imports utilities from `cosmwasm_std`.

## Core Concepts in `contract.rs`

The `contract.rs` file is at the heart of our IBC smart contract. This section will dive into some
of the primary structures and functionalities defined within it, providing a granular understanding
of the contract's inner workings.

### Imports and Dependencies

At the beginning of our contract, we import necessary components. Some of the crucial imports
include:

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{
    to_binary, Binary, Coin, CosmosMsg, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo,
    Response, StdResult,
};
```

These imports from `cosmwasm_std` library facilitate the creation, execution, and management of the
smart contract on the Coreum blockchain.

### Contract Metadata

Every contract should specify its name and version. This information often comes from the
`Cargo.toml` file.

```rust
const CONTRACT_NAME: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME");
const CONTRACT_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");
```

### Contract Entry Points

Here, we review the primary entry points of our contract:

#### 1. **Instantiation**

Instantiation is the process by which a smart contract is initialized on the blockchain. This is
analogous to deploying a contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The `instantiate` function is the
entry point that gets called during this initialization process.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {...}
```

**Function Parameters**:

-   **`deps: DepsMut`**: This is a mutable reference to the contract's dependencies. It provides
    access to the contract's storage, among other things.
-   **`_env: Env`**: Provides information about the blockchain's environment, such as the current
    block height and time.
-   **`_info: MessageInfo`**: Contains information about the incoming transaction, such as the
    sender's address.
-   **`_msg: InstantiateMsg`**: This is a custom data type that carries information specific to the
    contract's instantiation. It can include configuration parameters or initial data to set up the
    contract.

**Function Logic**:

Inside the `instantiate` function, the contract version is set using the `set_contract_version`
function. This ensures that the current version of the contract is stored within the contract's
storage.

Finally, the function returns a `Response` object with an attribute indicating that the
"instantiate" method was executed. This is primarily for logging and debugging purposes.

#### 2. **Execution**

Once a contract is instantiated on the blockchain, interactions with it are done via transactions.
Each of these transactions triggers the `execute` function, which serves as the contract's main
processing unit.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {...}
```

**Parameters**:

-   The first three parameters (`deps`, `_env`, and `_info`) are similar to the `instantiate`
    function and serve the same purposes.

-   **`msg: ExecuteMsg`**: Represents the specific action or instruction the contract should
    execute. It's a custom data type that can encapsulate various commands, much like an enum in
    Rust.

**Logic**:

The `execute` function uses a `match` statement to process the incoming `msg`. In this tutorial,
there's only one match arm for the `Transfer` variant of the `ExecuteMsg` enum. When a `Transfer`
message is received, the contract calls the `transfer` function to handle the IBC token transfer
logic.

### IBC Token Transfer

The process of transferring tokens between different blockchains requires a protocol that ensures
the secure and reliable exchange of assets. In our contract, this is achieved through the
Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Central to this capability is the `transfer`
function.

#### Function Signature

```rust
fn transfer(
    channel_id: String,
    to_address: String,
    amount: Coin,
    timeout: IbcTimeout,
) -> StdResult<Response>
```

#### Parameters:

1. **`channel_id: String`** - This represents the unique identifier for the IBC channel. The channel
   ID is essential for routing the transfer correctly between source and destination blockchains.

2. **`to_address: String`** - This is the recipient's address on the destination blockchain. Upon
   successful completion of the IBC transfer, the tokens will be credited to this address.

3. **`amount: Coin`** - The `Coin` type encapsulates the token denomination and the amount to be
   transferred. For instance, if you wanted to send 100 tokens of denomination "atom", the `Coin`
   object would represent this.

4. **`timeout: IbcTimeout`** - This denotes the time or block height by which the transfer should be
   completed. If the transfer doesn't occur before this timeout, the transaction is considered
   failed, and any locked assets on the source chain are released.

#### Function Logic:

The `transfer` function starts by creating an IBC transfer message:

```rust
let ibc_transfer_msg: CosmosMsg = IbcMsg::Transfer {
    channel_id,
    to_address,
    amount,
    timeout,
}
.into();
```

Here, the `IbcMsg::Transfer` structure is populated with the provided parameters. This structure
represents an IBC transfer request. Once populated, it's converted into a general `CosmosMsg`, which
is a more generic message type used within the CosmWasm framework for different blockchain
operations.

Subsequently, a response object is created:

```rust
let res = Response::new()
    .add_attribute("method", "transfer")
    .add_message(ibc_transfer_msg);
```

In this step:

-   A new response is initialized using `Response::new()`.
-   An attribute "method" with a value "transfer" is added to provide context for loggers or any
    front-end applications.
-   The previously constructed `ibc_transfer_msg` is attached to the response. This ensures that the
    IBC transfer is processed as part of the contract's execution.

Finally, the populated `Response` object is returned:

```rust
Ok(res)
```

By understanding the `transfer` function in detail, developers can gain insights into the IBC token
transfer mechanism within the contract. This function serves as a template for facilitating secure
and efficient cross-chain asset transfers. With minor modifications, developers can expand on this
foundation, introducing additional features or customizing the logic to better suit specific use
cases.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests ensure the contract's functionality and correctness. For instance, the `transfer` test
verifies the IBC token transfer process:

```rust
#[test]
fn transfer() {...}
```

The `contract.rs` file lays the foundation of our IBC smart contract. By understanding its
structures and functionalities, developers can modify, extend, or build upon it to create more
complex and feature-rich smart contracts for the Coreum blockchain.

## Makefile Commands

The Makefile provides commands for development and testing:

```bash
make dev # Build project
make test # Run tests

make build # Build wasm docker
make deploy # Deploy contract
make instantiate # create a new instance of contract

make get_count # retrive stored count value
make get_timeout_count # retrieve stored timeout count value

channels # get channels
ibc_transfer_cli # issue IBC transfer via cli command
ibc_transfer_wasm_timeout # execute IBC transfer using timestamp timeout
```

# Makefile IBC Commands

In this section, we'll explore various Makefile commands that interact with the IBC protocol using
the `cored` CLI tool. These commands facilitate querying IBC channels, initiating IBC transfers, and
making calls to WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts with specific timeouts.

## Detailed Command Explanations:

### 1. `channels`:

This command queries the IBC channels.

```bash
channels:
	cored query ibc channel channels $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS $COREUM_NODE_ARGS
```

**Description**:

-   `cored query ibc channel channels`: This command is used to query all the IBC channels
    available.
-   `$COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS`: Represents the chain ID arguments for the Coreum blockchain.
-   `$COREUM_NODE_ARGS`: Specifies the node-related arguments for the Coreum blockchain.

### 2. `ibc_transfer_wasm_timeout`:

This command calls a Wasm contract to initiate an IBC transfer with a specific timeout.

`NOTE:` using `9999999000001000000` as a timeout will make your transaction expire on Saturday,
November 20, 2286 5:30:00.001 PM. This is just for demo purposes.

```bash
ibc_transfer_wasm_timeout:
	cored tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "{\"transfer\":{\"channel_id\":\"channel-2\",\"to_address\":\"osmo1pwvcapna75slt3uscvupfe52492yuzhflhakem\",\"amount\":{\"amount\":\"2188\",\"denom\":\"udevcore\"}, \"timeout\": { \"timestamp\": \"9999999000001000000\" } }}" --from $DEV_WALLET -b block -y $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

**Description**:

-   `cored tx wasm execute`: This command is used to execute a Wasm contract.
-   `$CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Represents the address of the Wasm contract to be executed.
-   The JSON payload specifies the IBC transfer details and the timeout for the transfer.
-   `--from $DEV_WALLET`: Specifies the sender's wallet address.
-   `-b block`: Indicates that the transaction should be committed in the next block.
-   `-y`: Auto-approves the transaction without prompting for confirmation.

## Instantiating the IBC Wasm Contract

Once a smart contract has been compiled, the next step is to deploy it to the blockchain from the
wasm artifact we stored previously. This process is generally known as "instantiation". In this
section, we will overview the `instantiate` command provided in the Makefile, which is designed to
deploy (or instantiate) our IBC Wasm contract on the blockchain.

Instantiate the contract on the chain:

```bash
make instantiate
```

This will initialize a new instance of the contract from the stored wasm file.

### The `instantiate` Makefile Command:

```bash
instantiate:
	@echo "Instantiating the contract..."
	cored tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID "{}" \
	--amount="10000000$(COREUM_DENOM)" --no-admin --label "dev test" --from $DEV_WALLET --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -b block -y $COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS
```

**Command Breakdown**:

1. **`cored tx wasm instantiate`**: This is the base command used to instantiate a Wasm contract on
   the blockchain using the `cored` CLI tool.

2. **`$CODE_ID`**: Represents the unique identifier of the compiled Wasm contract code that you want
   to instantiate.

3. **`"{}"`**: This part of the command provides the initialization parameters for the contract. In
   this case, an empty JSON object is passed, indicating that no specific initialization parameters
   are required.

4. **`--amount="10000000$(COREUM_DENOM)"`**: Specifies the initial funds to be transferred to the
   contract upon instantiation. Here, `10000000` units of the `$(COREUM_DENOM)` token are
   transferred.

5. **`--no-admin`**: This flag indicates that the contract should not have an admin. Without an
   admin, certain administrative functions (like updating the contract) might be disabled.

6. **`--label "dev test"`**: Provides a label for the contract, which can be useful for
   identification purposes. In this instance, the label "dev test" is used.

7. **`--from $DEV_WALLET`**: Specifies the wallet address that will be used to pay for the gas fees
   and provide the initial funds. Here, the `DEV_WALLET` variable holds the address.

8. **`--gas auto`**: This allows the blockchain to automatically estimate the required gas for the
   transaction.

9. **`--gas-adjustment 1.3`**: Provides a multiplier to the estimated gas. This ensures that if the
   estimation is slightly off, there's still enough gas provided to complete the transaction.

10. **`-b block`**: Specifies that the transaction will wait until it's included in a block.

11. **`-y`**: This flag confirms that the command should proceed without manual confirmation.

12. **`$COREUM_NODE_ARGS $COREUM_CHAIN_ID_ARGS`**: These are additional arguments for the Coreum
    blockchain, specifying details like the node to connect to and the chain ID.

The `instantiate` command is essential for deploying your compiled Wasm contract to the blockchain.
Understanding each part of the command ensures you have full control and awareness of the deployment
process. Before running this command in a production environment, always double-check the provided
parameters, especially the wallet address and the amount of tokens being transferred.

## Execute Messages

Execute contract functions:

```bash
make ibc_transfer_wasm_timeout
```

This will send an IBC transfer:

```rust
let ibc_transfer_msg: CosmosMsg = IbcMsg::Transfer {
    channel_id,
    to_address,
    amount,
    timeout,
}
```

## Verifying Successful IBC Transfer

Succeful logs will have these messages (seen in explorer.coreum.dev):

```json
{
    "msg": {
        "transfer": {
            "amount": {
                "denom": "ucore",
                "amount": "1"
            },
            "timeout": {
                "timestamp": "9999999000001000000"
            },
