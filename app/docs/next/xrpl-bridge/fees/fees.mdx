# Fees

Every token listed in the registry includes a configuration for the bridging fee.

This fee is earned by relayers for facilitating transaction relay. It is designed to cover their
operational expenses while also ensuring a profit margin. The fee is deducted from the total amount
sent by the user.

After a transaction is executed, the bridging fees are allocated to the relayers' addresses. These
fees remain locked until a relayer manually claims them. The next section explain how to proceed.

## Claim fees

1. Enter the Docker container of the Relayer:

`docker exec -it coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer sh`

2. Execute the claim fees command:

`coreumbridge-xrpl-relayer coreum tx claim-relayer-fees --key-name coreum-relayer`

3. Enter the keyring passphrase when prompted.

You can then copy and past the transaction hash in the Coreum explorer to review it.

`Fees are distributed on the Coreum Network.`
