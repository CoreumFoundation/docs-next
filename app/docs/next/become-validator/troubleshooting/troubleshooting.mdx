# Troubleshooting

## Network connection

Ensure that your Node is visible by the other nodes within the network. 

You can check it by sending ping message from your local machine.
```bash
ping YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_IP
```

## Error parsing app.toml

If your `crudini` version is below 0.9.3, you might face the following issue:
```bash
Error parsing ~/.core/coreum-mainnet-1/config/app.toml: File contains parsing errors: <???>
[line 104]: ]
```
Please update your crudini version to 0.9.3 or open app.toml and replace next lines:
```bash
global-labels = [
]
```
with
```bash
global-labels = []
```
