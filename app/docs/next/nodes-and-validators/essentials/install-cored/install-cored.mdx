# Install cored

This document provides the instruction on how to install the release binaries of the `cored`.

Choose preferred way to install `cored`:

1. [Install **cored** and **cosmovisor**(for linux OS only)](#install-cored-and-cosmovisor)
2. [Install prebuilt **cored**(for linux OS only)](#install-prebuilt-cored)
3. [Build from sources](#build-from-sources)

## Install **cored** and **cosmovisor**

Note: this option supports linux OS only

In case you want to run any type of node, it's strongly recommended to run it with `cosmovisor`.
It allows automatically upgrading `cored` on the "chain upgrade".

* Verify that [network variables](/docs/next/nodes-and-validators/essentials/network-variables) are set up correctly.

* Create proper folder structure for `cosmovisor` and `cored`.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p $COREUM_HOME/bin
    mkdir -p $COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
    mkdir -p $COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades
    mkdir -p $COREUM_HOME/data
    ```

* Download `cored` and make it executable:
    * For Mainnet and Testnet:
      ```bash
      curl -LO https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases/download/$COREUM_VERSION/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME
      chmod +x ./cored-linux-amd64
      ```
      If you are getting 404 error at this step, run:
      ```bash
      echo https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases/download/$COREUM_VERSION/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME
      ```
      And check if it generates right link. It should lead to one of our <a className="text-[#24D494] font-bold" href="https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases" target="_blank">releases</a>.
      If it doesn't - double-check your network variables.

    * For Devnet:
      ```bash
      curl -LOf https://storage.googleapis.com/dev-cored-binaries/cored-linux-amd64
      chmod +x ./cored-linux-amd64
      ```

* Put `cored` to the right place:
  ```bash
  if [ "$UPGRADE_NAME" == "genesis" ]
    then
    export DESTINATION=$COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
  else
    mkdir -p $COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE_NAME/bin
    export DESTINATION=$COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE_NAME/bin
    ln -s $COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE_NAME $COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/current
  fi
  mv $COREUM_BINARY_NAME $DESTINATION/cored
  ```
  Explanation: if there was the network upgrade after the genesis, the proper destination for binary
  should be at cosmovisor/upgrades directory, not the cosmovisor/genesis.
  Also, we create the symlink for the cosmovisor, so it will start with the right binary.

* Finish downloading binaries and put them in the required folders.
    ```bash
    curl -LOf https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/download/cosmovisor%2F$COREUM_COSMOVISOR_VERSION/$COSMOVISOR_TAR_NAME
    mkdir cosmovisor-binaries
    tar -xvf "$COSMOVISOR_TAR_NAME" -C cosmovisor-binaries
    mv "cosmovisor-binaries/cosmovisor" $COREUM_HOME/bin/cosmovisor
    rm "$COSMOVISOR_TAR_NAME"
    rm -r cosmovisor-binaries
    ```

* Set the binaries PATH and the required environment variables.

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:$COREUM_HOME/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:$DESTINATION
    export DAEMON_HOME="$COREUM_HOME/"
    export DAEMON_NAME="cored"
    ```


* Test the binaries

    ```bash
    cored version
    ```

    ```bash
    cosmovisor version
    ```

That's it, you have `cored` and `cosmovisor` installed! You can return to previous Readme.

## Install prebuilt `cored`

Note: this option supports linux OS only. Also, it should be used in case you interact with the chain with the CLI only.

* Verify that [network variables](/docs/next/nodes-and-validators/essentials/network-variables) are set up correctly.

* Create a proper folder structure for `cored`.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p $COREUM_HOME/bin
    ```

* Download `cored`:
  * For Mainnet and Testnet:
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases/download/$COREUM_VERSION/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME
    ```
    If you are getting 404 error at this step, run:
    ```bash
    echo https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases/download/$COREUM_VERSION/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME
    ```
    And check if it generates right link. It should lead to one of our <a href="https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#24D494] font-bold">releases</a>

    If it doesn't - double-check your network variables.

  * For Devnet:
    ```bash
    curl -LOf https://storage.googleapis.com/dev-cored-binaries/cored-linux-amd64
    chmod +x ./cored-linux-amd64
    ```

* Put it in the required folder.
```bash
mv $COREUM_BINARY_NAME $COREUM_HOME/bin/cored
```

* Add `cored` to PATH and make it executable.

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:$COREUM_HOME/bin
    chmod +x $COREUM_HOME/bin/*
    ```

  **Attention!** *Set this variable globally so it will be automatically set after starting a new terminal session.*

* Test `cored`.

    ```bash
    cored version
    ```

That's it, you have cored installed! You can return to previous Readme.

## Build from sources

The <a href="https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/blob/master/README.md#build-and-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#24D494] font-bold">Build and Play</a> doc describes the process of building and installation the `cored` binary from sources.
