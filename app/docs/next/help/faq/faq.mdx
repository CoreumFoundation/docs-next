## How to point `cored` to a specific network?

By default, cored binary points to the local node(localhost:26657).

To point it to a specific node you should use two flags - `--node` and `--chain-id`.

For example status for the specific node can be retrieved this way:

```
cored status --node={NODE_URL_WITH_PORT} --chain-id={CHAIN_ID}
```

NODE_URL_WITH_PORT and CHAIN_ID can be found at
[network variables page](/docs/tutorials/get-started/setup-cli)

## How to fix `account not found` error?

If you see the next message:

```bash
Error: rpc error:
  code = NotFound desc = rpc error:
    code = NotFound desc = account testcore1q07ldrjnr8xtsy3rz82yxqcdrffu3uw3daslrw not found:
      key not found
```

Two reasons might cause this issue:

1. Your account probably has zero balance, and it is not visible on the network. You should
   [fund](/docs/tools/faucet) it before using it.
2. RPC node you used to send the request is not fully synced, use another RPC node or wait for sync
   completion.

## How to fix `key not found` error?

If you see the next message:

```bash
Error: testcore1f2dyj8dhdv62ytrkuvn832ezzjdcpg2jhrtzvy.info: key not found
```

Probably, your `RPC_URL` and/or `chain-id` belong to different networks. Also, this error often
occurs when you have added your account into a specific keyring (i.e. --keyring-backend=test) and
you forget to specify that keyring in CLI command.
