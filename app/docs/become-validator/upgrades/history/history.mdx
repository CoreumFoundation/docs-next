# Coreum upgrade history

## Run from genesis

To run a node with full block history you should:

1. Run it with cosmovisor
2. Provide all the binaries the chain used from the genesis and place it in the right place.
   For example, the network was upgraded two times with v1 and v2 upgrade,
   and if you want to run node from the scratch, the dir structure should be next:

```
cosmovisor:
---- genesis/bin/cored
---- upgrades:
-------- v1/bin/cored
-------- v2/bin/cored
```

::: warning
Please note, that each cored should have its own version, corresponding to the tables below.
:::

You can find needed `cored` version at [cored releases](https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases) page.

All other steps are the same to [run full node flow](/docs/become-validator/run-full-node), except state sync, which you should replace by steps
mentioned in current section.
