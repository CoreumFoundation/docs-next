# How to Upgrade my node

This guide describes instructions specific to each planned Upgrade of the `cored` binary.

## Before the Upgrade

### Prerequisites

You should run the node with cosmovisor(not with the `cored` binary directly),
since the cosmovisor takes care of stopping the node and replacing the binary version automatically when an Upgrade
should be applied.

If you run a validator using `cored`, you should rerun it with `cosmovisor` by
following [this instruction](/docs/become-validator/run-full-node).

### Proposal

When a new version of the binary is released, a proposal is created using governance.

You can check all proposals in two ways:

1. At the `proposal` section at the [block explorer](/docs/tools/blockchain-explorers)
2. By using CLI `cored q gov proposals` query.

### Voting

All the stakeholders and delegators may vote to support or decline the Upgrade proposal.
If the delegator doesn't vote, its voting power supports the vote made by the validator.

Vote command usage:

```bash
cored tx gov vote [proposal-id] [option] [flags]
# where
# proposal-id is a `proposal_id` field from the `cored q gov proposals` query
# option values are yes/no/no_with_veto/abstain
```

### Getting the Upgrade plan info

If more than 50% of the voting power votes "yes"(and "no with veto" is less than 30%), a new Upgrade plan is created.

You may query the pending Upgrade plan by issuing the command:

```bash
cored q upgrade plan
```

The result is like this:

```bash
height: "30012" # denotes the height when the Upgrade will be applied
info: "binary version" # provides more details, especially the version of the binary to install for that Upgrade
name: vX # is the name of the Upgrade
time: "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
upgraded_client_state: null
```

::: warning
Your node must be prepared for the Upgrade before the specified `height`.

Otherwise, after reaching that height, your validator will stop and risk to be slashed for being offline.

## Upgrades

### Mainnet v4 upgrade

#### Steps

* Set the next environment variables:

```bash
export COREUM_BINARY_NAME=$(arch | sed s/aarch64/cored-linux-arm64/ | sed s/x86_64/cored-linux-amd64/)
export COREUM_CHAIN_ID="coreum-mainnet-1"
export NEW_CORED_VERSION="v4.0.1"
export UPGRADE="v4"

# If you used your custom path to coreum, change it correspondingly
export COREUM_HOME=$HOME/.core/"$COREUM_CHAIN_ID"
```

* Download and verify the binary:

```bash
cd $HOME
curl -LO https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases/download/$NEW_CORED_VERSION/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME

# make it an executable.
# NOTE: This is super important to set binary's executable permission to everyone (`a+x`), not only for the owner (`u+x`).
# Otherwise `cosmovisor` will refuse to start the binary.
chmod a+x $HOME/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME

# Then verify the version:
$HOME/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME version
```

The printed version should match `v4.0.1`. If the version doesn't match stop following this tutorial immediately!
Continuing will lead to serious problems.

[//]: # (The printed version should match the one specified in the `cored q upgrade plan` `info` field.)

[//]: # (WARNING: If the version doesn't match stop following this tutorial immediately! Continuing will lead to serious problems.)

* Verify that the `cored` binary is executable by the user you used to run cosmovisor.

* Move the `cored` binary:

```bash
# Cosmovisor requires a new binary to be placed in the precise location. Create appropriate directory:
mkdir -p "$COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE/bin"

# Replace the new binary there
mv $HOME/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME "$COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE/bin/cored"
```

### Testnet v4 upgrade

#### Steps

* Set the next environment variables:

```bash
export COREUM_BINARY_NAME=$(arch | sed s/aarch64/cored-linux-arm64/ | sed s/x86_64/cored-linux-amd64/)
export COREUM_CHAIN_ID="coreum-testnet-1"
export NEW_CORED_VERSION="v4.0.1"
export UPGRADE="coreum%20v4"

# If you used your custom path to coreum, change it correspondingly
export COREUM_HOME=$HOME/.core/"$COREUM_CHAIN_ID"
```

* Download and verify the binary:

```bash
cd $HOME
curl -LO https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/releases/download/$NEW_CORED_VERSION/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME

# make it an executable.
# NOTE: This is super important to set binary's executable permission to everyone (`a+x`), not only for the owner (`u+x`).
# Otherwise `cosmovisor` will refuse to start the binary.
chmod a+x $HOME/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME

# Then verify the version:
$HOME/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME version
```

The printed version should match `v4.0.1`. If the version doesn't match stop following this tutorial immediately!
Continuing will lead to serious problems.

[//]: # (The printed version should match the one specified in the `cored q upgrade plan` `info` field.)

[//]: # (WARNING: If the version doesn't match stop following this tutorial immediately! Continuing will lead to serious problems.)

* Verify that the `cored` binary is executable by the user you used to run cosmovisor.

* Move the `cored` binary:

```bash
# Cosmovisor requires a new binary to be placed in the precise location. Create appropriate directory:
mkdir -p "$COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE/bin"

# Replace the new binary there
mv $HOME/$COREUM_BINARY_NAME "$COREUM_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/$UPGRADE/bin/cored"
```
