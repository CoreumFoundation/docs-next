# Set connection config

This document describes the common connection configuration for any type of node.

* If you use your own or custom config, please set a `consensus.timeout_commit` to `1s`.

* Set Node config
```bash
COREUM_NODE_CONFIG=$COREUM_HOME/config/config.toml
```

* Your Node should have public IP, which you should set there:
```bash
COREUM_EXTERNAL_IP={YOUR_VM_PUBLIC_IP}
```
* Have you put your actual public ip in previous command?

* (Optional) You can check if IP is public by sending ping command to its address from your local machine.

* Update node config with COREUM_EXTERNAL_IP
```bash
crudini --set $COREUM_NODE_CONFIG p2p addr_book_strict false
crudini --set $COREUM_NODE_CONFIG p2p external_address "\"tcp://$COREUM_EXTERNAL_IP:26656\""
crudini --set $COREUM_NODE_CONFIG rpc laddr "\"tcp://0.0.0.0:26657\""
```

* To enable rpc and p2p connections, apply the following command in config.toml
```bash
crudini --set $COREUM_NODE_CONFIG rpc laddr "\"tcp://0.0.0.0:26657\""
crudini --set $COREUM_NODE_CONFIG p2p laddr "\"tcp://0.0.0.0:26656\""
```
Pay attention that ports need to be properly exposed on the instance settings to allow outbound traffic to rpc, p2p, rest and grpc ports
